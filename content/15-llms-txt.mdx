Click the `llms.txt` link in the header above to see the LLM-friendly version of this page.

## What is llms.txt?

The [llms.txt specification](https://llmstxt.org/) is a proposed standard for providing LLM-friendly content. It uses Markdown to structure information in a format that's easy for language models to understand.

## Configuration

Enable llms.txt in your `veslx.yaml`:

```yaml
site:
  llmsTxt: true
```

This enables:
- `/llms.txt` - Index with links to all articles
- `/llms-full.txt` - Full content of all articles inline
- `llms.txt` link in each post's frontmatter

## Format

The llms.txt format includes:

1. **H1 Title** (required) - The name of the document
2. **Blockquote Summary** - A short description
3. **Content** - The main markdown content, stripped of frontmatter and JSX components

This makes it easy to copy documentation content directly into an LLM conversation without the noise of HTML, navigation, or interactive components.
