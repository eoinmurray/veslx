<VeslxFrontMatter />

This repo deploys the static build to GitHub Pages using a workflow that runs on every push to `main`.

## Build output
`veslx build` writes a static site to `dist/`. GitHub Pages serves that folder.

## Workflow (same as this repo)
Create `.github/workflows/pages.yml`:

```
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      - name: Install deps
        run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Build
        run: bun run build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Custom domain (optional)
If you use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` step before upload:

```yaml
- name: Add CNAME
  run: echo "your.domain.com" > dist/CNAME
```

## GitHub Pages settings
- Repository Settings → Pages
- Source: "GitHub Actions"
- Branch: leave blank (Actions handles deployment)
- Custom domain: set it here if you’re using one (and keep the CNAME step)
- Enforce HTTPS: enable once DNS has propagated

## Repo permissions checklist
- Actions → General → Workflow permissions: "Read and write permissions"
- Actions → General → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests (optional)

These settings match the permissions used by the workflow (`pages: write`, `id-token: write`).

Push to `main` and the workflow will publish the site.
