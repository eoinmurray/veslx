<FrontMatter />

I made VESLX because I needed a static site generator for personal scientific use that supports:

- zero config and can read a directory of `.mdx` files out of the box.
- MDX files for interactive components.
- fast to start and fast to build.
- hot reloads quickly during development.
- math rendering.
- slides.
- complex image galleries.
- easy to print pages as pdf.
- llms.txt for AI integration.
- posts and docs with a simple convention (dates).
- powered by a modern web stack that I already know (Shadcn, Tailwind, React, TypeScript, Vite, Bun).

Veslx supports these featurs in an opinionated way so you can focus on writing content rather than configuring the toolchain.
If you need more flexibility, might be better served with other tools.
