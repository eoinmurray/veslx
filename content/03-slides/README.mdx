# Creating Slides

Files named `SLIDES.mdx` render as slide decks.

## Basic Example

Create `my-talk/SLIDES.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: "My Presentation"
---

# Welcome

First slide content.

---

# Second Slide

Use `---` to separate slides.

---

# Final Slide

Done.
```

## Separator

Three dashes on their own line create a new slide:

```mdx
Content for slide 1

---

Content for slide 2
```

## Navigation

- **Arrow keys** (← → ↑ ↓) - Navigate slides
- **j / k** - Vim-style navigation
- **Scroll** - Scroll between slides

The header shows slide progress and navigation buttons.

## Slide Components

Use built-in components for common slide layouts.

### HeroSlide

Opening/title slide:

```mdx
<HeroSlide
  title="Neural Networks"
  subtitle="A deep dive into modern architectures"
  author="Dr. Jane Smith"
  date="December 2024"
/>

---

# Next slide...
```

### TextSlide

Content slide with bullets or text:

```mdx
<TextSlide title="Key Findings" subtitle="From our research">
  - Model accuracy improved by 12%
  - Training time reduced by 40%
  - Memory usage remained constant
</TextSlide>
```

### Using Gallery in Slides

Images work in slides:

```mdx
<Gallery path="./images" limit={1} title="Results" />
```

## Print to PDF

Slides print in landscape orientation. Use your browser's print function (Cmd+P / Ctrl+P) to export as PDF.

## Live Example

See the [example slides](./SLIDES.mdx) in this folder.

## Tips

- One idea per slide
- Code blocks render with syntax highlighting
- Math equations work with KaTeX
- Keep text readable at presentation size
