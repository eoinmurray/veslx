Veslx is a small static site generator for MDX-first docs and slides. It favors simple defaults and fast feedback.

## Why did I build Veslx?

I needed a lab notebook for my academic research. I needed something with:

1. Pages and slides for sharing results.
2. MDX support for complex pages and components.
3. Math support for equations.
4. Beautiful gallery components for plots and images.
5. LLMs.txt support so I could use my notebooks as LLM context.
6. Zero config so I could focus on writing, not setup.
7. Static interactive pages for complex visualizations.
8. Fast feedback local so I could iterate quickly.
9. Easy deployment to GitHub Pages for sharing results.

## Veslx is a good fit for you if:
- You want zero config docs.
- You like MDX for interactive notes.
- You want slides in the same repo as docs.

## Veslx is not a good fit for you if:
- You need a very custom build pipeline.
- You want a full CMS or multi-tenant system.
