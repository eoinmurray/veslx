<VeslxFrontMatter />

## Content directory
Veslx scans the current folder by default. Point it elsewhere with

```sh
veslx serve yourcontentfolder
```

or in `veslx.yaml`:

```yaml
dir: content
```

## Frontmatter
Every page can define metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "My Page"
description: "Short summary"
date: "2025-01-15"
draft: true
visibility: "hidden"
---
```

- `date` makes it a post.
- `draft` or `visibility: "hidden"` hides it from listings.

## Docs vs posts
- Docs: no `date`
- Posts: with `date`

Routes:
- `/docs`
- `/posts`
- `/all`

## Ordering
1. Numeric prefix
2. Date
3. Alphabetical

## Subfolders and index pages
Put a `README.mdx` in a folder to create a section index.
Use `<VeslxPostList />` to list pages in that folder.

## Custom homepage
Put `README.mdx` (or `index.mdx`) at the root of your content directory to replace the default homepage. This is the common place to build a custom landing page and group lists of content.

```mdx
---
title: "Welcome"
description: "Start here."
---

# Docs
<VeslxPostList globs={["00-*", "01-*"]} />

# Guides
<VeslxPostList globs={["guides/*"]} />
```

## URLs
Paths follow your folder layout. A file `guides/intro.mdx` becomes `/guides/intro`.
