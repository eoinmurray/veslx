**Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet**, consectetur adipiscing elit. Content is authored
in MDX, where prose and components coexist without ceremony. Frontmatter defines
intent, not constraint. Pages are compiled ahead of time, hydrated only where
meaning demands it.

**Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut markdown renders fast**, code blocks stay
readable, and components remain optional. No runtime templating, no CMS gravity
well. Just files, builds, and artifacts.

**Ut enim ad minim veniam**, the site ships as plain HTML, predictable and
inspectable. JavaScript is earned, not assumed. The generator disappears; the
content remains.

**Et nihil obstat, content lives in version control**, revisions leave an audit
trail, and authorship is explicit even when the voice is not. The pipeline is
boring on purpose: write, build, deploy. Like a quiet cloister for documents—no
engagement metrics, no pop-ups—just text, code, and time.
