# Getting Started

veslx serves MDX files as a documentation site. No config required.

## Prerequisites

veslx requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) to be installed:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Installation

```bash
bun install -g veslx
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
bunx veslx serve
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd your-docs-folder
veslx serve
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## What Happens

veslx scans your folder for `.mdx` files and:

- Lists them on a homepage with Posts/Docs filtering
- Renders MDX with syntax highlighting and math support
- Treats `SLIDES.mdx` files as presentations
- Provides dark/light theme toggle
- Hot-reloads on changes

## File Structure

Any folder structure works:

```
my-docs/
├── getting-started.mdx     # A page
├── api-reference.mdx       # Another page
├── tutorials/
│   ├── 01-basics.mdx       # Numbered for ordering
│   ├── 02-advanced.mdx
│   └── SLIDES.mdx          # A slide deck
└── images/
    └── diagram.png         # Referenced in MDX
```

## Frontmatter

Add metadata to any MDX file:

```yaml
---
title: "My Page Title"
description: "Shows in the listing"
date: "2025-01-15"        # Makes it a "post"
draft: true               # Hide from listings
---
```

Content with a `date` field appears under Posts. Content without appears under Docs.
