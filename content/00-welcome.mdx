<FrontMatter />

Veslx is a small static site generator for MDX-first docs and slides. It favors simple defaults and fast feedback.

## Good fit
- You want zero config docs.
- You like MDX for interactive notes.
- You want slides in the same repo as docs.

## Maybe not
- You need a very custom build pipeline.
- You want a full CMS or multi-tenant system.

## Next
- [Quickstart](./01-quickstart.mdx)
- [Core concepts](./02-core-concepts.mdx)
- [Configuration](./08-configuration.mdx)
