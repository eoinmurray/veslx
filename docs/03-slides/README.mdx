# Creating Slides

Files named `SLIDES.mdx` or ending in `.slides.mdx` render as slide decks.

## Example

Create `my-talk/SLIDES.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: "My Presentation"
---

# Welcome

First slide.

---

# Second Slide

Use `---` to separate slides.

---

# Final Slide

Done.
```

## Separator

Three dashes on their own line:

```mdx
Content for slide 1

---

Content for slide 2
```

## Navigation

- **Arrow keys** - Next/previous slide
- **Space** - Next slide
- **Number keys** - Jump to slide
- **Escape** - Exit fullscreen

## Live Example

See the [example slides](./SLIDES.mdx) in this folder.

## Notes

- One idea per slide
- Code blocks work
- Math works
- Images work

## Print

Slides print in landscape. Use Cmd+P / Ctrl+P to export PDF.
